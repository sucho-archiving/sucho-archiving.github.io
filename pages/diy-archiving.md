## About the workshop

Worried that websites, digital art, or data that you care about might be at risk? This workshop on DIY web archiving will teach you how to create your own offline backups of things you care about on the internet. Absolutely no prior technical experience required, you only need access to a laptop or computer; all are welcome. You will be able to walk away with a web archive of your own!

Weâ€™ll cover:
* Making a copy of websites / webpages with the ArchiveWeb.page browser plugin
* Using Browsertrix for making a copy of larger websites
* Checking for malware on websites
* Best practices for organizing and storing websites, images, and other materials
* Capturing metadata so you know what you have
* Alternatives to big tech tools and platforms

## Who we are

This workshop is co-sponsored by [SUCHO](https://www.sucho.org/) (Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online), [ACH](https://ach.org/) (the Association for Computers and the Humanities), and [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.net/). SUCHO organized a large-scale effort to archive at-risk Ukrainian cultural heritage starting in 2022, bringing together librarians, technologists, and even children to do hands-on web archiving. ACH is the US-based professional association for digital humanities. Webrecorder develops open-source tools for high-fidelity web archiving.
