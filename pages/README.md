# Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO)

We are a group of more than 1,300 cultural heritage professionals – librarians, archivists, researchers, programmers – working together to identify and archive at-risk sites, digital content, and data in Ukrainian cultural heritage institutions while the country is under attack. We are using a combination of technologies to crawl and archive sites and content, including the [Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), the [Browsertrix crawler](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) and the [ArchiveWeb.page browser extension and app](https://archiveweb.page/) of the [Webrecorder project](https://webrecorder.net/). So far we have saved more than 20TB of scanned documents, artworks and many other digital materials from 3,000+ websites of Ukrainian museums, libraries and archives.

# How can I help?

## Volunteering 
0. No clue what's going on? Visit our [orientation page](https://www.sucho.org/orientation).
1. [Submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffa64-l6qXqEumAcf38OEOrTFeYZEmF531PNv9ZgzNFbcgxQ/viewform) important URLs for collections in cultural heritage institutions in Ukraine
2. If you can read Ukrainian or Russian, or if you can run the Browsertrix crawler (check out our [Browsertrix Crawler documentation](/browsertrix) to see if it's something you'd be up for trying), fill out the [volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6KbhtEOI8zKsQmKT_waE1XlYEF1E6t-HzJ7Gc1EBfMvMg_A/viewform). 
3. We are currently at capacity for people to help with Wayback Machine / Internet Archive tasks or manual Webrecorder tasks, but you can still help by submitting URLs.

You'll need to wait until we add you to the Slack to actually get started, but if you want to read about the process, here's our [workflow](/workflow) and a [orientation for new volunteers](/orientation).

## Financial support

**Visit our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/sucho) to support us financially.**

SUCHO and [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.net/) are raising funds for a **Browsertrix support engineer** position to actively help volunteers troubleshoot web archiving work, and improve the open-source tools and documentation. Our aim is to put web archiving in the hands of anyone who wants to participate in preserving digital cultural heritage.
Additionally, we are looking for monthly supporters to help us rent a 100TB storage server from where we can back up the data we have collected to academic institutions around the world for safekeeping.
