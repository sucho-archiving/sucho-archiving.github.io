# SUCHO Database of Web-Archived Content
February 24, 2025

URL: https://www.sucho.org/press-release-20250224

Today marks the third year of the full-scale Russian invasion. The effort launched by SUCHO in 2022 to archive web-based cultural heritage of Ukraine resulted in our archiving of more than 50TB of data from websites that range from national archives to local museums, from 3D tours of churches to childrenâ€™s art centers.

All of the archived web content is now accessible through the [SUCHO Database of Web-Archived Content](https://database.sucho.org/). The database includes metadata about the archived resources, as well as statistics about online status, collection timeline, and completeness. We are recrawling content from previously crawled domains to make sure new materials or updates are also archived. Not all metadata records are complete. Please reach out if you find any discrepancies or errors.

Thank you to the SUCHO volunteers who web archived all of the content. We are especially grateful to the people who developed the metadata template, and continued to clean and disambiguate the data, including Mira Barka, Olena Sharafanenko, Yuliia Parkhomenko, Sasha Goryl, Kiley Jolicoeur, and Anna Kijas. The inventory database and public interface was developed by Andreas Segerberg.

We continue to securely host and mirror the content that has been web archived since 2022. Please [donate now](https://www.sucho.org/donate) to help us pay for ongoing costs to securely store web archived content from cultural heritage institutions.

If you are an institution whose website or collection was web-archived and would like to be reunited with your data, please contact the SUCHO coordinators at info at sucho.org.
